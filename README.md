A python script that turns a PowerPoint [pptx] file into a video. The PowerPoint should have text written in the speaker notes. The result is a mp4 video file with text-to-speech from the speaker notes and a video of the slides. 

Note: Script does not correctly function. I need to find a way to capture slides, perhaps using Pillow.
